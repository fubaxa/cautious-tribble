# Simulator calibration notes

What the simulator implements, the trace evidence for it, and what's still open. All traces are
DynamicButter physics traces (v5 unless noted) from GD 2.2091 at 240 physics steps/s.

## Status

`tools/tracediff.py` on `0_test_1794191254.csv` (level `test`, all 2.2 physics options on):
**4,893 of 5,570 cube steps match, with no differences.** The run has 7,334 steps; the other
1,764 are a ball section, which the diff skips (it puts the simulator back into the
game's state on the next cube step on the ground). The diff stops only at things not built yet:
the pink dash orb and the spider orb. 132 steps were near misses (open issue 1).

Covered by that run: floor, jumps (pressed and held), fall cap, gravity portals, all speed portals,
mini and normal size portals, red pad, blue pad, yellow / pink / red / green / black / blue orbs,
green dash orb, landing on blocks, the snap on a 2x staircase, the level end.

This is one recorded run on one level. Every rule below needs more runs before it's trusted.

## Measured rules

- **Step 1 after a spawn doesn't move the player.**
- **x** (float32): `x = f32(x + xVel * 0.25)` — exact on all 15,373 checked steps.
  xVel (double) per speed: 0.5x 4.1860013287128206, 1x 5.1930015618800667,
  2x 6.457002339951754, 3x 7.8000023138976102, 4x 9.6000033430511955.
- **y** (float32): `y = f32(y + yVel * 0.225)` at every speed, using the step's new yVel.
- **Cube gravity** per step: 0.5x 0.212, 1x 0.216, 2x 0.215, 3x/4x 0.216 (normal and mini equal).
  yVel stays on multiples of 0.001: `round(yVel ± g, 3)`.
- **Cube jump** yVel: 0.5x 10.62, 1x 11.18, 2x 11.42, 3x 11.23 (4x not measured); mini = 0.8x.
- **Floor** top at y = 90 (player centre 105 at normal size).
- **Gravity portals** (2.2 options on): the step moves with the old gravity, then the portal flips
  gravity and halves yVel (10.152 -> 5.076). yVel is stored with its real-world sign.
- **Speed portals**: plain axis-aligned overlap of the player's 30x30 hitbox with the portal's;
  the step that touches still moves at the old speed, xVel changes for the next step.
  Hitboxes (w x h, centred): 0.5x 35x44, 1x 33x56, 2x 51x56, 3x 65x56, 4x 69x56.
- **Rotated portals** (not implemented): fire on the first step where the player's oriented
  hitbox overlaps the portal's oriented hitbox (12/12 cases). Player OBB in wave: 10x10, mini 6x6.
- **Event timing**: orb/pad/trigger touches happen after the move, on the hitbox of that step.
- **Order inside a step**: move, land, then the step's input, then objects (see sim/physics.py).
  An input row carries the already-moved position.
- **Jump**: a new press on the ground sets yVel on that step and y first moves on the next one.
  A button already held when the player lands jumps on the following step, and that step already
  moves with the jump velocity.
- **Fall cap**: cube yVel stops at -15.
- **Mini portal**: size changes on the touching step, y is kept; the player then falls to the floor.
  Normal portal while standing mini: y is kept for that step, the floor lifts the player on the next.
- **Pads**: set yVel on the touching step, after the move: yellow 16, pink 10.4, red 20 (mini 16).
  Blue pad: flips gravity, yVel = 5.12 (mini) in the new falling direction.
- **Orbs** need a press that hasn't been used yet (a press is used by a jump or an orb, and dropped
  on release). With a press on the ground while touching an orb, the orb wins. Values at the
  measured speed: yellow 11.18 (1x), pink 8.05 (1x), red 15.76 (2x), green 11.42 and flip (2x),
  black -15 (2x), blue: flip and fall at 4.568 (2x).
- **Green dash orb**: from the next step yVel is 0 and y stays constant while the button is held;
  gravity returns the step after the release.
- **Blocks**: landing when the player's bottom was at or above the top on the previous step:
  y = top + half size, yVel 0. Block 467 behaves like block 1.
- **Snap, confirmed on 3 landings at 2x**: predicted x = (x - block x at the previous landing) +
  new block x; x moves toward it by at most 2. The first block after the floor doesn't snap.
- **Level end**: the sprite x stops while the hitbox keeps moving for the end animation.

## Open issues

1. **1-ulp noise in yVel and y.** On ~5% of airborne steps GD's yVel is 1 ulp off `round(v, 3)`,
   and y is 1 float32 ulp off `f32(y + yVel*0.225)`. Tried: plain add, round/floor/trunc with
   /1000 or *0.001, fmod/remainder, float32 gravity, per-segment `start + 0.216*n`, double y
   accumulation — none above ~95.7%. Probably one upstream cause inside GD. The trace diff counts
   these as near misses and continues from the game's value.
2. **Spider pad (3005)** fires without its listed hitbox overlapping the player's.
3. **Pink dash orb**: flips gravity and dashes; on the use step yVel was scaled by 0.5 once and
   by 0.6 once (-1.935 -> -0.9675, 2.15 -> 1.29). Rule unknown, so it isn't implemented.
4. **Assumptions in the block code, not yet tested**: the snap applies only on a landing; the
   reference offset is taken at the landing (not while standing); landing on the floor clears it;
   contact with a block's side or underside stops the simulator instead of deciding.
5. `x`/`y` in traces are the sprite position: stale on the 2nd+ step of a multi-step frame. The
   diff uses `posX` (hitbox centre, ~1e-7 less precise) on those steps.
